#AWS-Services 

Amazon EC2 - It offers your choice of processor, storage, networking, operating system,  
  
etc. to match your applications need. Here, the software gets installed, patch instance,  
  
manage scaling and availability, configure storage and then write application code and  
  
deploy to your instance.  
  
Instance Types:  
  
⦁ General Purpose - balanced mix of CPU, memory, and storage.  
  
⦁ Compute Optimized - greater focus on compute power and are ideal for  
  
applications requiring high performance processors.  
  
⦁ Memory Optimized - They are primarily used for large-scale enterprise class in-  
  
memory applications.  
  
⦁ Accelerated Computing - Utilize hardware accelerators or co-processors to perform  
  
floating-point calculations faster and more efficiently.  
  
⦁ Storage Optimized - Instances in this family use SSD backed instance storage for  
  
low latency and I/O performance.  
  
⦁ PC Optimized - Designed for high performance computing.  
  
Purchasing options for EC2 instances:  
  
⦁ Scheduled: Scheduled instances run on a recurring schedule, either daily, weekly,  
  
or monthly; however, you would still be charged if not running the instance.  
  
⦁ Reserved: Reserved instance type is suitable for long-term predictable workloads.  
  
⦁ Spot: Spot instances are best for unpredictable, periodic workloads.  
  
⦁ On-demand: On-demand instances are used for short-term where workloads can  
  
be irregular and where the workload can be interrupted.  
  
EC2 Image Builder – You build an image by making use of dropdowns that have all the  
  
resources (for ex: memory, storage, instances etc.) required for an application.  
  
Elastic Beanstalk - Upload your application and elastic beanstalk automatically deploys  
  
the AWS resources such as EC2 resources, auto scaling groups, RDS database instances,
